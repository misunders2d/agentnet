# Public Package Status

Snapshot: 2026-07-27

This additive status note reconciles public package availability with AgentNet's
frozen `0.1.28` release evidence and the `0.1.29` callback repair candidate. It
does not replace requirements, gate ledgers, or accountable-owner evidence.

## Current public package

Reads of the public npm registry and immutable Git tag returned:

- package: `@misunders2d/agentnet`
- latest published version: `0.1.28`
- published package `gitHead`: `b10a9fb8e390cdff5f7efe2175a12fb2f960c76e`
- annotated tag `v0.1.28` peels to the same commit

Package availability does not authorize deployment and does not establish
production readiness.

## Frozen release-input clarification

The retained `0.1.28` wheel and sdist under
`evidence/local/2026-07-27-v0.1.28/artifacts/` are immutable release evidence.
Their packaged release inputs retain their pre-publication snapshot. Those
frozen bytes are not rewritten after publication. `scripts/verify_release.py`
checks each candidate against its own release snapshot.

The Hub installed and verified exact public `0.1.28`. A real owner Google OIDC
attempt then exposed an application defect before callback claim: the Approval
handler required exactly two total query parameters and rejected valid unique
provider metadata. The transaction remained pending, callback unclaimed, and
owner bindings/passkeys remained zero. Candidate `0.1.29` repairs owner,
enrollment, and recovery callback handling with global duplicate-name rejection,
strict disjoint success/error projections, ignored unique unknown extensions,
and exact state-bound terminal provider-error handling without token exchange.
Its focused callback suite reports `92 passed`; source and both recursively
packed generations each report `1443 passed, 16 expected skips`; release,
package, reviewer, and reproducible-build gates pass. The exposed callback URL
is not reusable and must not be retried. Fresh-laptop
enrollment resumes only after reviewed public `0.1.29` installation and a new
OIDC transaction; native cross-host message/ACK remains pending.

## Release and gate posture

`RELEASE_MANIFEST.json` remains controlling for release eligibility:

- status: `BLOCKED`
- `production_ready=false`
- `ship_eligible=false`
- no must-not-ship gate is `PASSED`
- G04 remains `FAILED`
- G10 remains `PARTIAL`

No deployment, setup, enrollment, restart, authority grant, or gate promotion
is implied by this note.
